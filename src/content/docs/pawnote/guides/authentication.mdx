title: Authentication
description: Probably the first thing you want to do when using Pawnote is authenticating to your account, otherwise you won't be able to do much.

import { Tabs, TabItem, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can authenticate to PRONOTe using three different methods :

- Credentials
- QR Code
- Token

## Credentials

You can use your credentials from PRONOTE to directly authenticate.
This method will then give you a token that can be used to reauthenticate later.

     <TabItem label="npm">
```typescript
import { authenticatePronoteCredentials, PronoteApiAccountId } from "pawnote";

const client = await authenticatePronoteCredentials("https://demo.index-education.net/pronote", {
  accountTypeID: PronoteApiAccountId.Student,
  username: "demonstration",
  password: "pronotevs",

  // This is a unique identifier that will be used to identify the device
  // with the server. It can be anything, but it must be unique.
  deviceUUID: "my-device-uuid"
});
```
      </TabItem>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Dart/Flutter">
```dart
final client = await Authenticator.withStudentCredentials(
  loginPortalUrl: 'https://demo.index-education.net/pronote',
  username: 'demonstration',
  password: 'pronotevs',

  // This is a unique identifier that will be used to identify the device
  // with the server. It can be anything, but it must be unique.
  deviceUuid: 'my-device-uuid'
);
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## QR Code

When generating a QR Code on the client, you should decode it manually to get the data inside of the QR Code.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JS/TS">
    ```typescript
import { authenticatePronoteQRCode } from "pawnote";

const client = await authenticatePronoteQRCode({
    pinCode: "XXXX", // 4 numbers you provided in Pronote.
    dataFromQRCode: {
    jeton: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    login: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    url: "https://.../pronote"
  },

  // This is a unique identifier that will be used to identify the device
  // with the server. It can be anything, but it must be unique.
  deviceUUID: "my-device-uuid"
});
    ```
