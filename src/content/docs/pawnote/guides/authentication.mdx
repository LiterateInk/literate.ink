title: Authentication
description: Probably the first thing you want to do when using Pawnote is authenticating to your account, otherwise you won't be able to do much.

import { Tabs, TabItem, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can authenticate to PRONOTe using three different methods :

- Credentials
- QR Code
- Token

## Credentials

You can use your credentials from PRONOTE to directly authenticate.
This method will then give you a token that can be used to reauthenticate later.

  // This is a unique identifier that will be used to identify the device
  // with the server. It can be anything, but it must be unique.
