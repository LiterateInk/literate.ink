## Why Pawnote ?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Multi-language" icon="rocket">
    Supports JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart and Flutter, and more languages to come !
  </Card>
  <Card title="Support for 2023 version" icon="approve-check">
    Pawnote supports the latest version of PRONOTE, and should also support version 2022 and earlier
    but some properties can be wrong or `null`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For everyone" icon="star">
    Pawnote is giving you the ability to interact with PRONOTE's internal API without having to worry about the implementation,
    just use the abstractions and you're done.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Same flow as the UI" icon="puzzle">
    Pawnote tries to have the same flow as the official client UI so that it can provide full context depending on what is requested.
  </Card>
